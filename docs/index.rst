Introduction
------------

https://Apility.io can be defined as Threat Intelligence SaaS for developers and product companies that want to know in realtime if their existing or potential users have been classified as 'abusers' by one or more of these lists.

Automatic extraction processes extracts all the information in realtime, keeping the most up to date data available, saving yourself the hassle of extract and update regularly all these lists and the data.


What does Apility.io offer?
---------------------------

Apility.io offers an extremely simple and minimalistic API to access in realtime to these lists and do the following simple question about the resource?

Is this IP, domain or email stored in any blacklist?

The answers to this question can be:

* YES: The resource can be found in an abusers' list. This is a bad resource.
* NO: The resource cannot be found in any abusers' list. This is a clean resource.

A bad resource implies some kind of action from developers' side. A clean resource does not need any action from their side.
